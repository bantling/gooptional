Implementation of optional similar to Java.

== Main differences from Java

- Single constructor for both initial cases of empty and with a value
- Comparisons made by Filter, where gofuncs provides conjunction, disjunction, negation, and equality.
- Implements goiter.Iterable, provides an iterator of zero or one elements
- Since goiter.Iter has specialization methods such as IntValue and NextIntValue, there is no need for specialized classes like Java OptionalInt
- Implements database/sql/driver Scanner and Valuer interfaces for compatibility with values read from/written to a column
- Implements Stringer to return "Optional" or fmt.Sprintf("Optional (%v)", value)

== Constructors

Of(...interface{}) returns an empty Optional if no args are passed or nil is passed, or a present Optional with the first arg passed.
