= gooptional

Implementation of optional similar to Java.

== Main differences from Java

- Single constructor for both initial cases of empty and with a value 
- Contains negative methods (NotEqual, NotEqualValue, FilterNot)
- Compares against another Optional (Equal/NotEqual) or against another value (EqualValue/NotEqualValue)
- Implements goiter.Iterable, provides an iterator of zero or one elements
- Since goiter.Iter has specialization methods such as BoolValue and NextBoolValue, there is no need for specialized classes like Java OptionalInt 
- Has both MapTo{float, int, string} and FlatMapTo{float,int,string}
- Implements database/sql/driver Scanner and Valuer interfaces for compatibility with values read from/written to a column

== Constructors

Of(...interface{}) returns an Optional that is empty if no args are passed, or present with the first arg passed.
